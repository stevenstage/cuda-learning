# Cuda-learning
This is my personal notes and summeries on learning GPU acceleration. The course materials are mainly sourced from [this project](https://github.com/gpu-mode/lectures), but I will also share my personal study notes and code execution results. Similarly, when faced with unsatisfactory results, I will modify the code to present it as perfectly as possible.

In my opinion, this is an excellent course and resource for learning GPU acceleration, and I hope it will be helpful to those interested in this field!
